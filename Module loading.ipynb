Relevant Health Board specific material will be included. Students will be informed of the requirements of the e-portfolio and the schedule of formative and summative assessments.\\n\\nClinical Placements:\\nScotGEM year 3 students will learn in a Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship model based on those which have been  used in the USA and elsewhere since the 1970s to address workforce shortages in rural and remote areas. The model has been developed further in Australia and North America where there was a need to train generalist clinicians and address recruitment problems. The model is being increasingly used for clinical medical education globally and has been piloted in Dundee (DLIC) with positive evaluation by students, clinical teachers and patients. \\n\\nStudents are based individually or in pairs in general practices. They spend around 50% of their time working as part of the practice teams with the supervision of a named GP tutor. The rest of the week is not formally timetabled; students have the flexibility to self-direct and self-regulate their learning in other clinical environments, such as secondary care services, with the support of their GCM and local NHS faculty. There is a focus on continuity of patient-centred care and students are expected to follow patients’ healthcare journeys through a variety of health care and social services. As a result, students learn about continuity of care, patient-centred care and delivery of care across traditional boundaries. \\nStudents will have short episodes of involvement in acute secondary care where they will have the opportunity to work with medical, surgical, paediatric and possibly psychiatric and obstetric teams for 24-36 hours to gain experience of managing acute illness and its immediate follow up. The number and nature of these experiences will depend upon local service configurations. \\nThe timetable for each week will be variable and flexible to permit students to prioritise their learning needs according to their patients’ health care journeys and other drivers. \\n\\nStudents are expected to involve themselves in the delivery of health care in all clinical settings and also in the community in which they learn.\\n\\nAs some students will be placed in more remote areas where access to larger District General or Tertiary Hospital care may not be practical, occasional weeks will be offered in such centres to provide learning experiences unavailable to them in their regions.  The number of such weeks will be dependent on local service configurations. \\n\\nThe GP tutors will provide clinical supervision for students and the GCMs will provide educational supervision, facilitate clinical learning and maintain an overview of students’ progress. The GCMs work with groups of 3-5 geographically related students to co-ordinate weekly tutorials which support students with de-briefing, educational supervision and some teaching tailored to the group’s self-identified learning needs.  Assistance in identifying these needs is provided through the portfolio PDP process and informed by the GMC Outcomes for Graduates 2018 and MLA requirements.\\n\\nIn year three students will conduct a single Agents of Change project requiring up to 10% of their time in total.  A range of options are available based upon existing Dundee student ‘4th Year project formats’, including writing an article for publication and GP, community or regional hospital based healthcare improvement projects. \\n\\nInternationally, there are several LIC models; the Dundee model is comprehensive1 in that the majority of the learning outcomes for an entire academic year are met across multiple disciplines simultaneously, and is ‘dispersed immersed2’ in that students spend the year away from traditional tertiary hospital teaching sites\\n\\n[1] Worley P, Couper I, Strasser R, Graves L, Cummings B-A, Woodman R, et al.A typology of longitudinal integrated clerkships.

We will also work with LLC to ensure there is student-directed IT support. \\nWe believe our learning outcomes accommodate all protected characteristics.\\nWe have aimed to promote flexibility by allowing modules to be taken in any order, which should support access to the modules at times suitable for the learners (subject to there being appropriate numbers to run an iteration of the module). Resources are developed to be accessible to participants with a range of impairments, e.g. use of alt-tags on images; provision of transcripts for videos used, though we are aware this is not always available on some of the YouTube links we direct students to. \\nFormative assessment is spread across a variety of methods, including coursework, participation in group activities. To maintain flexibility the submission link (for summative work) is open from the early stages of the module, so students can submit any time up to the deadline.  Assessment materials and procedures will be maintained in strict accordance with the University policy on Inclusion, allowing for access to all participants and employing a range of strategies which address the spectrum of needs which may exist in a given cohort. \\nStudents are encouraged to disclose, without prejudice, any barriers to learning which they might have so that the University’ Disability Services can be informed, with a view to advising how best to manage the learning needs of individuals.  Feedback will be given in a timely and considerate manner, either face to face or via electronic communication.  All individualised feedback will be given in confidence and shared only by those members of the Teaching Team who require access to this information.\\n',\n",

It focuses primarily on medical management, as other aspects of care (e.g. self- management/ behaviour change) are covered in other modules. This module will be of most interest to doctors and possibly pharmacists.\\n\\nThe module will allow students to improve their clinical knowledge and application in the treatment of complex patients with diabetes and acute and chronic complications. This includes sub-speciality areas such as genetic forms and secondary causes of diabetes, diabetes in pregnancy, diabetic renal disease, cardiovascular risk and diabetic foot disease.',\n",

The role of environmental and genetic factors in diabetes will be discussed and debated.\\xa0\\nPharmacotherapies\\nAll the currently available therapies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be described, and using clinical examples, students will be taught how to use and combine these drugs effectively. Different insulin regimes and their various benefits will be discussed and taught using problem based learning.\\xa0\\nComplications\\nAcute complications of diabetes that present to hospital services (including HONK, DKA, lactic acidosis and severe hypoglycaemia) will be discussed, and students taught protocols and regimes for their effective management.\\nDiabetes in Pregnancy\\nDiabetes in pregnancy is a growing challenge with rising rates of T2DM in younger women. We discuss the international trends in diabetic pregnancy, diagnostic criteria, and the various regimes and therapies used for management of diabetes in pregnancy. The impact of glycaemic control on pregnancy outcomes will be discussed using the latest evidence based literature.\\nDiabetes \\xa0Renal Disease\\xa0\\nRenal disease is common in the diabetic population and early detection and appropriate management is required to prevent further deterioration. The pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease will be discussed and students taught how to manage secondary effects of renal disease including renal osteodystrophy, hypertension, changes in electrolyte balance, anaemia \\xa0etc. \\xa0A joint care approach with renal teams will be encourage for patients with severe renal impairment.\\nCardiovascular Risk\\nThe increased cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes needs to be managed aggressively. Students will learn about cardiovascular risk calculators and evidence based guidelines that can be used to aid in clinical management.\\xa0 The pathophysiology of hypertension and dyslipidemia (normal/altered), unusual causes, and\\xa0 epidemiology of both along with \\xa0the role of the health care professional in lifestyle modifications that relate to C-V risk. \\nDiabetes Foot Disease\\nPrevention and early appropriate management of diabetes foot problems is essential to reduce associated morbidity and mortality due to ulceration, neuropathic pain, neuro-arthroses and amputation. Prevention, evidence based treatment strategies and appropriate referral pathways will be encouraged.\\n',\n",

It is expected from students to cover the study material and recommended references, which will be developed and made available online, and to complete the assignment(s).  Tutor support will be offered and peer-to-peer interactions will be maintained using an online forum. \\n\\nThroughout the module, students’ learning is supported using the VLE tools (e.g. messaging, discussion forums, synchronous tutorials, and activities). All staff involved are experienced in creating, delivering and supporting educational programmes in a variety of formats relevant to this approach. The VLE is maintained by educational technologists who ensure that the PG Moodle Site works effectively for both staff and students. Moodle is customised regularly with additional tools e.g. for monitoring student and staff activity and communication. These support staff give technical assistance and e-learning advice during module preparation and delivery. \\nKey readings in each area listed will be discussed, analysed and then placed in the context of practice. Participants will undertake a series of exercises in practice designed to facilitate critical analysis of their own organisation in these areas\\nAs part of a continuing process of improvement and in parity with the other modules in presentation, data on the effectiveness of teaching methods/technology as well as meeting student expectations will be gathered in an online survey at the start and end of this module.
