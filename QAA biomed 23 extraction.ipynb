      "Adding point 1.2 \tA Biomedical Science degree will include all the key clinical laboratory specialities (Medical Microbiology (including virology), Clinical Biochemistry, Haematology and Transfusion Science, Clinical Immunology, Cellular Pathology/Histopathology and Clinical Genetics), enabling graduates to achieve the academic requirements needed to apply for registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a Biomedical Scientist (protected title). Eligibility for HCPC registration can be achieved by award of an IBMSaccredited honours degree plus a placement/period of training in an IBMS-approved training laboratory where the IBMS Registration Training Portfolio is undertaken and successfully verified (either during the degree or post graduation).  \n",
      "Adding point 1.3 A degree in Biomedical Sciences is generally broader and may encompass other human biology courses. Courses following this curriculum can be delivered with the title of Biomedical Sciences, or with various named awards or specialisms in the degree title such as pharmacology, molecular biology or cell biology. The potential absence of taught material in some or all of the key clinical laboratory specialities summarised in paragraph 1.2 results in these courses not meeting the HCPC academic requirements for registration as a Biomedical Scientist. However, there are opportunities for students to ‘make up’ this limitation by undertaking additional ‘top-up’ modules to meet the clinical skills requirement. The IBMS will advise on which additional modules are required to be completed and this will be in addition to a time in clinical practice to complete the IBMS certificate of competence portfolio. Upon successful completion, students may apply to HCPC to gain registration. \n",
      "Adding point 1.4 Honours degree courses in either Biomedical Science or Biomedical Sciences are designed to provide graduates with a broad understanding of the scientific basis of human health and disease. Graduates from these courses will develop the qualities needed for employment in situations which require the exercise of professionalism, critical independent thought, personal responsibility and decision-making in complex and unpredictable circumstances.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.5 \tThis Statement is intended to be valuable to potential students, their supporters and sponsors, employers, professional and regulatory bodies, universities, colleges and schools.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.6 Biomedical Science degrees are suitable for accreditation by the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) and provide the academic foundation for application to register with HCPC as a Biomedical Scientist, if combined with a period of clinical laboratory training. Degree courses which incorporate integrated and appropriate placement experience may also be approved directly by HCPC, enabling graduates to become eligible to apply for HCPC registration as a Biomedical Scientist. The content of these degrees, and subsequent delivery, is developed in close cooperation with Biomedical Scientists in practice to ensure requirements for HCPC registration are met, particularly where professional practice placement opportunities are offered. Further information of the roles of the HCPC/IBMS and degree routes to registration are provided in Appendix 1 and paragraphs 1.13 to 1.15 below. \n",
      "Adding point 1.7 Graduates from degrees in either Biomedical Science or Biomedical Sciences enter a rapidly changing employment environment in which lifelong learning plays an essential role. Graduates of both degree courses can attain additional qualifications before or after taking up employment, including master’s degrees (MSc, MRes), doctoral degrees (PhD/DPhil and Professional Doctorates), postgraduate medical and teaching qualifications and other professional qualifications offered by IBMS. \n",
      "Adding point 1.8 An IBMS-accredited Biomedical Science degree is primarily focused on producing graduates who can enter NHS or private clinical diagnostic pathology laboratories, including Blood Transfusion Services and Public Health Wales, but can also lead to a variety of careers. \n",
      "Adding point 1.9 Both Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences degrees are considered as an excellent basis for a wide variety of graduate-entry career paths, including:  \n",
      "new subsection life science and pharmaceutical industries  \n",
      "new subsection research laboratories and institutes  \n",
      "new subsection sales and marketing related to healthcare and diagnostic products  \n",
      "new subsection education: school, further and higher education  \n",
      "new subsection food industry and food safety  \n",
      "new subsection forensic laboratories  \n",
      "new subsection clinical trials and regulatory sector.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.10 Hands-on practical laboratory work forms an essential part of Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences courses. It allows students to develop the necessary technical skills for a career in this area and ensures they are competent and capable of safe and accurate working in a clinical/industrial/laboratory environment.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.11 Research skills developed within a Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences degree provide students with the ability to develop ideas, critically appraise literature, plan and carry out original investigations independently and assess and report the significance of outcomes. In addition, research skills prepare students effectively for professional employment or postgraduate research degrees in the subject areas.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.12 Graduates from Biomedical Science courses will develop skills and knowledge to enable interpretation of clinical laboratory and near-patient test results through their taught modules, completing the IBMS Registration Training portfolio and being HCPC registered, which facilitates a contribution to multidisciplinary approaches to healthcare.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.13 Biomedical Scientist is the protected title awarded by HCPC for those who carry out a range of laboratory investigations and scientific techniques on tissue samples and fluids to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and provide expert advice for the treatment of patients and prevention of disease.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.14 Those wishing to use the protected title of Biomedical Scientist are required by statute to register with HCPC which is the regulatory body, created under the 1999 Health Act. Eligibility to apply for registration is based on achieving the HCPC Standards of Proficiency for the safe and effective practice of registrant biomedical scientists.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.15 The role of the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) in this process is as the awarding body for the Certificate of Competence. This award provides evidence that individuals have met the competency requirement of the HCPC Standards of Proficiency for Biomedical Scientists. This verifies that they are ‘fit to practice’ as a Biomedical Scientist and are therefore eligible to apply for professional registration with HCPC. Since 2010, IBMS has been approved by HCPC to award the Certificate of Competence to graduates of IBMSaccredited degree programmes who have also successfully completed the IBMS Registration Training Portfolio. \n",
      "Adding point 1.16 This Subject Benchmark Statement expects the biomedical science and/or biomedical sciences learning communities to commit to equity, inclusive access and practices that anticipate the diverse needs of their community members. \n",
      "Adding point 1.17 This Statement asks the learning community to address issues of inclusion throughout, and advocates intentional support for diverse student cohorts, acknowledging that equality and diversity are inter-dependent. Promoting equity of opportunities for all, through considered course design and development, is underpinned by valuing and harnessing differences and treating everyone with dignity and respect. Course teams should create an environment that encourages openness and participation, where everyone feels respected, supported, valued and understands their personal responsibility for equality and inclusive practice. Inclusive environments for learning anticipate and accommodate the varied requirements of learners and ensures equitable access to educational opportunities. Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences courses should proactively raise awareness of equality, equity, diversity and inclusivity through integrated activities and discussions. They should be designed to address issues in global healthcare, including factors affecting access to good quality diagnosis and treatment. Course providers, staff and students all have a role in, and responsibility for, promoting equality and diversity and challenging biases and stereotypes, that is regularly reviewed and updated in line with institutional and government guidance. \n",
      "Adding point 1.18 Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences are subjects whose underpinnings rely upon objective observation. It is important, however, to recognise and proactively discuss and confront the historical factors that have influenced many aspects of these subject areas. Courses should critically engage with how the field has contributed to and benefited from social injustice by, for example, presenting a balanced and informed history of the field and acknowledging that influential scientists might have benefited from and perpetuated misogyny, racism, homophobia, ableism and other prejudices. Students will be encouraged to consider how individual biases, culture and society as a whole influence biomedical science and/or biomedical sciences, including what science is done, what is considered ethical, who does that science, how data is interpreted and how biological knowledge is used. This should include critical examination of current practices and incorporation of a diverse range of underrepresented sources, including work from scientists from marginalised communities, plus case studies and learning materials representing the full range of human diversity. Courses should be regularly reviewed to consider whether teaching materials and subject matter covered might inadvertently perpetuate biases and stereotypes. \n",
      "Adding point 1.19 Curricula should recognise the discoveries and contributions of Biologists and Biomedical Scientists with diverse backgrounds and identities and acknowledge that different cultural backgrounds provide different insights and lead to new discoveries. Furthermore, learners should have the opportunity to explore Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences topics that inspire them and allow them to situate their knowledge in the light of their lived experiences or cultural backgrounds. Students should be encouraged to evaluate both the positive and negative impacts of potential applications of biological discoveries and reflect on the ways in which knowledge of Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences might be exploited for political, commercial or capital ends, for example drug development and targeting, in ways that can further gender-based, ethnicity-based or other inequalities. \n",
      "Adding point 1.20 Equity involves enabling access to the programme of study for people who have differing individual requirements alongside eliminating arbitrary and unnecessary barriers to successful learning. Access should be equitable and based on an individual’s potential to complete the Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences course.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.21 Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences course teams must pay attention to ensuring that curricula, pedagogy, assessments and practical elements of courses are designed to be fully accessible and flexibly designed. All students should be offered learning and assessment opportunities that are equally accessible to them, using inclusive design wherever possible and by means of reasonable individual adjustments where necessary. Learning and assessment experiences should be diverse to reflect the variety of the subject, to test a range of academic and practical skills and to increase accessibility for all.  \n",
      "Adding point 1.22 Equitable access to the course for all students should be proactively and flexibly considered in an anticipatory way, including fieldwork, laboratory work and placements. Different requirements should be addressed with flexibility in assessment and teaching methods built in. Social capital, culture, sexuality, disability, neurodiversity and other characteristics should not prevent students from having equitable access to the entire curriculum. The team should refine and improve the course to remove barriers in response to feedback. Course teams should work in close collaboration with student support to ensure both the staff member and student are fully supported to ensure the curriculum is accessible to all students. \n",
      "Adding point 1.23 Sustainability and sustainable development are key considerations in Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences, as they are vital to managing earth resources to promote the long-term well-being of the planet and all its inhabitants. It is important to note that sustainability is not solely about the environment. It is an ongoing process of addressing social, environmental and economic concerns to create a better world, and, as such, has particular relevance to Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences. Practical considerations might include reducing paper use, the LEAF initiative for improving the sustainability and efficiency of laboratories and discussion of ethics and environmental impact of laboratory work, replacing chemicals with sustainable alternatives if possible, and consider glassware in place of disposable plastic. An awareness of waste reduction, bioremediation, careful use of all non-renewable resources, alternative energy sources and pollution control can be explored in the curriculum. Where applicable, consideration could also be given to assessment design. \n",
      "Adding point 1.24 The application of sustainable development in the higher education sector takes place through Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which is the process of creating curriculum structures and subject-relevant content to support and enact sustainable development. As stated in the UNESCO 2019 definition, ‘ESD is holistic and transformational education which addresses learning content and outcomes, pedagogy, and the learning environment. It achieves its purpose by transforming society’, a vision which is consistent with the aspirations of the Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences disciplines. An understanding of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is essential to this vision. \n",
      "Adding point 1.25 To support the inclusion of sustainable development within Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences, users should refer to the QAA and Advance HE Education for Sustainable Development Guidance to address teaching and learning for sustainable development, key competencies, learning outcomes and assessment within the curricula. \n",
      "Adding point 1.26 Employability is a set of competencies, demonstrated by combined knowledge, skills and behaviours that make individuals more likely to gain employment and be successful in their chosen occupations, benefiting themselves, society and the economy.  It includes problem identification and solving, innovation, creativity, expression, communication and practical action. Entrepreneurship enhances employability by promoting personal development. It fosters those attributes that enable students to transition into successful graduates, actively participating in society and identifying opportunities to develop a meaningful career combined with the creation of cultural, social and economic value. These attributes are integral in both Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences, although the emphasis within the learning outcomes may differ. Developing close links with employers and involving them in curriculum and assessment design will positively enhance graduate employability. Employability and entrepreneurship focus on competencies (knowledge, skills and behaviours) plus transferable themes such as business awareness, professional ethics, health and safety, the development of reflection and self-awareness, personal motivation, and accountability. \n",
      "Adding point 1.27 Enterprise and entrepreneurship education supports behaviours, attributes and competencies that are likely to have a significant impact on the individual student in terms of successful careers. It prepares students for changing environments and provides enhanced impact through placements and activities that build links between academic institutions and external organisations. \n",
      "Adding point 1.28 Beyond employment, entrepreneurship education provides competencies to help students lead a rewarding, self-determined professional life, well placed to add social, cultural and economic value to society through their careers. \n",
      "Adding point 1.29 Enterprise and entrepreneurship education can be co-created with multiple stakeholders (for example, employers, professional bodies, service users or patients) and may cover a range of topics, such as project planning and management, financial, environmental or personal sustainability, innovation, intellectual property, and commercialisation. Ideally, these topics may be explored through subject-specific applications based on real-world examples. \n",
      "Adding point 1.30 Alumni, entrepreneurs and other relevant specialists (for example, practitioners) may be invited as visiting lecturers and guest speakers, ensuring that tasks and assessments are authentic and support learning through self-reflection. Collaborative work in the course can promote teamworking and negotiation and leadership skills that can improve employability. The student will take responsibility for continuing personal and professional development, demonstrating a commitment to learning and self-improvement and supporting the development of others, as appropriate. \n",
      "Adding point 1.31 More information can be found in the QAA document Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Education: Guidance for UK Higher Education Providers.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.1 There is a variety of Biomedical Science and Biomedical Sciences courses across the UK. This diversity is a strength, as it allows students to choose a course that aligns with their interests and is suited to their individual needs and aspirations. Some courses contain the required curriculum of the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS), including specific clinical specialisms. As explained in section 1, these courses enable students to meet the education standards of the HCPC and are called Biomedical Science (singular). Students should confirm the accreditation status of the programme before they apply. Other courses that encompass broader areas of human biology related to health and disease can be called Biomedical Sciences (plural).  \n",
      "Adding point 2.2 There are a range of possible paths to admission to degree courses. The majority of courses require A Level Biology and Chemistry or equivalent, but many courses provide alternatives for those choosing to study Biomedical Science or Biomedical Sciences, regardless of prior educational background. Science foundation years are delivered by both universities and colleges, that enable applicants without a relevant Biology and/or Chemistry qualification to develop foundational knowledge prior to progressing onto an honour’s degree programme. \n",
      "Adding point 2.3 Undergraduates in Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences will study a standard bachelor’s degree with honours (FHEQ Level 6; FQHEIS Level 10). For Biomedical Sciences only, students may have the opportunity to study an integrated master’s degree with honours (FHEQ Level 7; FQHEIS Level 11). These degrees have distinct learning outcomes to reflect the level of the award. Bachelor’s degrees provide students with subjectspecific knowledge, understanding and skills, as well as the wider transferable skills and attributes that prepare graduates for a range of careers. Integrated master's degree courses (such as MBio or MSci) encompass both bachelor's degrees with honours and master's degree outcomes. An integrated master's degree is awarded after an extended course of study which allows students to study topics in Biomedical Sciences to a greater depth and to further develop specialist knowledge, advanced skills and undertake project work. Standalone master’s (MSc and MRes) degree courses in Biomedical Science or Biomedical Sciences are self-contained courses, normally involving one or two years of postgraduate study. \n",
      "Adding point 2.4 Biomedical Science courses may contain optional or integrated periods of placement/assessed professional practice in an IBMS-accredited laboratory that offers the opportunity to complete the IBMS Registration Training portfolio. Successful completion and verification of the IBMS Registration Training portfolio together with a completed IBMSaccredited BSc Hons Biomedical Science degree programme allows graduates to apply to register with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a Biomedical Scientist. Some Biomedical Sciences programmes may offer different placements at organisations in the biosciences industrial sector, or the opportunity to study at an international university. Such placements may last for a term, semester or an entire year. Credit awarded during such a placement may vary according to the learning and assessment workload during the experience. Credit-bearing placements should, however, be integrated within the programme of study, so that students can relate their experience to, and use the skills that they have developed in, their academic study. Many providers also offer or facilitate non-credit-bearing industrial and research placement experiences during vacations to enhance student experience and development. \n",
      "Adding point 2.5 Where an institution offers several similar courses, for example Biomedical Science, Biomedical Sciences, Human Nutrition, Pharmacology and Human Physiology, these will typically be based around a common core of shared compulsory modules, especially in the early years, with options in later years that allow students to specialise. This modularity enables both flexibility and efficiency of delivery and may even allow students to defer selection of award title until later years by retaining the option to transfer between cognate courses. \n",
      "Adding point 2.6 \tThe academic component of degree apprenticeships in Biomedical Science or Healthcare Science Practitioner should follow the guidelines in this Subject Benchmark Statement. Degree apprenticeships in higher education are covered explicitly in the Characteristics Statement for Higher Education in Apprenticeships which describes the general characteristics and distinctive features of apprenticeships in the UK.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.7 All degree courses covered in this Statement can ensure that all students are offered learning and assessment opportunities that are equally accessible to them, as described in the Equality, diversity and inclusion section. This should be incorporated by means of inclusive design wherever possible and by means of reasonable individual adjustments where necessary. Learning and assessment experiences should be diverse to both reflect the variety of the subject and to increase accessibility for all.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.8 Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences course teams can also ensure that curricula, pedagogy, assessments and practical elements of courses are designed to be fully accessible. All learners should be supported in their development of the full range of verbal, spatial and numerical skills, alongside other approaches required to successfully complete their course. \n",
      "Adding point 2.9 Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences degree course should be designed to promote academic and personal development. Initially, students will apply their knowledge and understanding of simple concepts to solve well-defined problems. As the course advances, they will develop confidence in their subject-specific knowledge and understanding, making connections between more challenging and complex concepts that enable them to analyse and evaluate data and problem solve effectively. On graduation, students will be competent in a range of knowledge, understanding, experience and skills. Graduates from Biomedical Science degrees only (following an appropriate period of clinical training, and completion of the IBMS Certificate of Competence) are equipped to begin a career as an HCPC-registered Biomedical Scientist. Graduates from both Biomedical Science and Biomedical Sciences programmes may find employment in a variety of other sectors. \n",
      "Adding point 2.10 The learning, teaching and assessment methods used should encourage a progressive acquisition of subject knowledge and skills. Students will move gradually from highly structured tasks that ‘scaffold’ learning and support the transition into university to managing their own learning and undertaking independent tasks. This progression should be reinforced by strategies that: \n",
      "new subsection recognise the diversity of prior experience and the challenges of transition \n",
      "new subsection allow all students to achieve their potential and realise their ambitions, irrespective of their background or motivations for studying Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences \n",
      "new subsection support academic and personal development in addition to learning \n",
      "new subsection are matched to the course learning outcomes or competencies for each level  of study. \n",
      "Adding point 2.11  Students on a Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences degree course will progress from one level or academic stage to the next by satisfying the regulations and processes for each institution. These require the students to demonstrate that they have met at least the threshold standard for the level of study. This will usually include successful completion and the award of credit for the full range of learning and assessment, including practical components. Students may also be required to meet additional criteria, such as passing all core clinical specialisms on an IBMS-approved Biomedical Science programme. The standard required to progress on a Biomedical Sciences integrated master’s degree course may also be higher than that for a bachelor’s course.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.12  Subject to the regulations for the institution, students will usually be offered an opportunity to re-sit any failed assessments, particularly where that prevents either progression or qualification for an award. Students who are not eligible to progress, or who choose to leave a course of study early, may be eligible for a Certificate of Higher Education, a Diploma of Higher Education, or a Pass degree, depending on the amount and type of credit successfully completed. Integrated master’s degrees typically also offer a bachelor’s degree with honours as an exit award for those who have attained sufficient credit but are not able to complete the course. Bachelor’s degrees with honours from institutions in Scotland are typically designed to include four years of study, which relates to the structure of primary and secondary education in Scotland. For students following part-time routes, their study time would be the equivalent of the three or four-year degree.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.13 The diversity in the types of courses offered in Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences is also reflected in diverse modes of delivery. While many courses are delivered full-time, some offer part-time and/or distance learning study. Biomedical Sciences courses may also offer students the opportunity to study abroad or industrial placements. The range of delivery methods (both face-to-face and digital) utilised are also diverse and appropriate for the needs of the learner, the taught material and their assessments. The progressive acquisition of knowledge and skills within the subject area also enables flexibility between courses, both within and between institutions, with mechanisms available for the transfer of credit between institutions.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.14 Given that Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences courses must contain practical skills acquisition, course teams need to consider how they will support the development of practical skills, employing both bench practical sessions supported by online tutorials and virtual practical skills that may be acquired in a range of environments.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.15 Courses also need to be sufficiently flexible to be able to respond to and anticipate change, both in the advancement of the subject and its interface with other disciplines and in the needs of its graduates and their employers, as required. Courses should be sufficiently resilient to be able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances such as the Covid pandemic and other challenges that may arise in the future. \n",
      "Adding point 2.16 Providers may operate in academic partnerships with further education and international colleges or with international degree providers to enable study-abroad programmes. Some providers also offer partnership programmes that give advanced standing to students with prior study abroad, for admission into year two or three of existing UK degree courses. Industrial and NHS collaborations may also be utilised for partnership delivery of degree apprenticeships. Providers are expected to develop processes for oversight to ensure that partners involved in degree delivery meet all relevant standards and expectations. This should include effective communication and regular consultation to ensure that courses continue to meet employers’ needs. \n",
      "Adding point 2.17 Courses should work with relevant stakeholders to incorporate work-based or worklike learning where possible. Enhancing student employability is a fundamental outcome for Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences courses. Therefore, engagement with the relevant employment sectors should be extensive. The courses should have a clear strategy for students to have the opportunity to develop employment-focused skills and engage with employers. Students may engage with employers through paid and/or unpaid placements of various durations during which students will be fully immersed in the workplace and experience the day-to-day routine of employment. Funding or payment should be considered to ensure that placement opportunities are inclusive and accessible to all. \n",
      "Adding point 2.18 Student societies provide excellent opportunities for students to collaborate with their peers both socially and professionally.

Students are able to provide guidance, feedback and support for their own learning in several ways, this can be through departmental representatives, module, course and external student surveys such as the National Student Survey (NSS). Furthermore, students can feed into, and collaborate with, their students’ union, and many universities offer public social media platforms to receive feedback from students and discuss current trends in the student experience. Students should be involved in quality review processes and can be invaluable during the curriculum review and development of new courses where student steering groups may be established.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.20 Degree-awarding bodies and their collaborative partnerships routinely collect and analyse information and undertake periodic course review according to their own needs. They draw on a range of external reference points, including this Statement, to ensure that their provision aligns with sector norms. Monitoring and evaluation are a periodic assessment of a course, conducted internally or by external independent evaluators. Evaluation uses information from both current and historic monitoring to develop an understanding of student achievement or inform future course planning.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.21 Monitoring and review should include feedback from current students, external stakeholders, such as employers and placement providers, and alumni, to influence curriculum design, content and delivery. There should also be feedback from employers and apprentices for degree apprenticeships. \n",

      "Adding point 2.23 Evaluation of student performance data and various measures of the student experience should be integrated with expert review, including that provided by external examiners.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.24 Externality is an essential component of the quality assurance system in the UK. Higher education providers will use external reviewers as part of periodic review to gain an external perspective on any proposed changes and ensure threshold standards are achieved and content is appropriate for the subject.  \n",
      "Adding point 2.25 The external examination system currently in use across the UK higher education sector also helps to ensure consistency in the way academic standards are secured by degree-awarding bodies. Typically, external examiners will be asked to comment on the types, principles and purposes of assessments being offered to students. They will consider the types of modules on offer to students, the outcomes of each cohort and how these compare to similar provision offered by other UK higher education providers. External examiners are asked to produce a report each year and make recommendations for changes to modules and assessments (where appropriate). Subject Benchmark Statements, such as this one, can play an important role in supporting external examiners in advising on whether threshold standards are being met in a specific subject area. \n",
      "Adding point 2.26 Undergraduate Biomedical Science and/or Biomedical Sciences degree courses sometimes require more than one external examiner to cover the breadth of material covered in the programme. \n",
      "Adding point 2.27 Programme and course teams should also conduct regular monitoring and evaluation, with the support of independent evaluators and student feedback, to ensure continuous quality enhancement. Evaluation of student performance data as well as student feedback and student voice alongside other measures of the student experience should be integrated with expert review, including that provided by external examiners, to ensure the curricula remain current, engaging and accessible. Historic data may also enable trend analysis to measure progress and identify emerging issues. Students and graduates, as well as employers, service users and relevant professional bodies, should be actively involved in designing and delivering enhancements to courses of study.  \n",

In this context, there is an expectation that all staff who contribute to student learning – including demonstrators, and temporary and visiting lecturers, as well as permanent academic staff – should have access to a range of educational professional development opportunities. Current strategies are student-centred and utilise a range of delivery methods, as appropriate, to incorporate experiential, practical and formal academic practice. Teaching sessions may be synchronous, asynchronous or a blend of modes. Synchronous delivery may be face-to-face, remote or a hybrid of these, to increase accessibility. Asynchronous learning is typically delivered using a range of digital tools and techniques. Live sessions may be recorded for self-directed study and consolidation of learning. Independent learning can be encouraged using pre/post-sessional student activity. It is considered good practice to use a range of different activities and reflect on how, for example, module choice by students might influence the range of activities available to them. ',\n",
